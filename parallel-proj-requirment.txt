Projects 1-3 are done on the HUAWEI Cloud, which consists of at least four VMs.
Project 1: Have a fun with parallel programming with MPI
MPI_ALLGATHER: Use MPI_SEND and MPI_RECV to implement the MPI_ALLGATHER function, and compare the performance of your implementation and the original MPI implementation.

Gemm: Initialize a random 1024 *1024 matrix, and implement the matrix multiplication function. Please parallelize the program in the tile unit.
Using a 4 * 4 kernel to do the pooling operation for the matrix.

Using a 4 * 4 kernel to do the convolution operation for the matrix.

Wordcout:
We will provide one folder which contains 100 small files and one folder which contains 1 big file.

Implement the wordcount algorithm respectively for the two situations and print the results to the screen.

Analysis: Benchmark your program with different numbers of processors and host nodes. Give an analysis on your program's output.

Project 2: Have a fun with parallel programming with OPENMP
Monte Carlo algorithm:

Using OpenMP to implement the Monte Carlo algorithm.

Quick Sort:
Using OpenMP to implement a quick sorting algorithm with large data volume which contains 1000000 number.
PageRank:
Initialize a graph has 1, 024, 000 nodes and the edge count of different nodes ranges from 1 to 10. Implement the PageRank algorithm and run for 100 iterations.
Analysis: Benchmark your program with different numbers of processors and host nodes. Give an analysis on your program's output.

Project 3: Big Data Analysis in Hadoop System
Requirements

Each student group should propose a project proposal, which is targeting at implementing weatherdata program using MapReduce.

Weatherdata is a project to get the temperatures from the website, which is available on http://ram-n.github.io/weatherData/

You need use your weatherdata program to get the statistics of the highest and lowest temperature for all the files in the data directory, respectively.
